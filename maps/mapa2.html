    <desc id="desc6"> A blank Map of Europe. Every country has an id which is its ISO-3166-1-ALPHA2 code in lower case.
      Members of the EU have a class="eu", countries in europe (which I found turkey to be but russia not) have a
      class="europe".
      Certain countries are further subdivided the United Kingdom has gb-gbn for Great Britain and gb-nir for Northern
      Ireland. Russia is divided into ru-kgd for the Kaliningrad Oblast and ru-main for the Main body of Russia. There
      is the additional grouping #xb for the "British Islands" (the UK with its Crown Dependencies - Jersey, Guernsey
      and the Isle of Man) and the Kingdom of Denmark (Denmark, Faroe Islands, Greenland)
